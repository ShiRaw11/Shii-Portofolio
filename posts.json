React enables developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of those components efficiently.

JSX makes it easier to create React elements and components by allowing you to mix HTML with JavaScript. This syntax is transformed into plain JavaScript by tools such as Babel, which React uses to render UI components."

They are JavaScript functions or classes that return React elements, which describe what should be rendered on the screen. Components can be classified as functional or class-based: Functional Components are simpler and typically used for presenting UI, while Class-Based Components offer additional features like lifecycle methods and are used for more complex scenarios."

When the state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated data. State is fundamental for handling user interactions and asynchronous data in React applications."
